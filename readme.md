# About
This is a simple random password generator I've created to get familiar with Java Swing and hopefully less outdated java gui libraries as I progress. 

## Extra Functionality To Be Added
<ul>
  <li> Ability to input a random or chosen word into the password </li>
  <li> Ability to select how many special characters/numbers/uppercase and lowercase letters are included </li>
 </ul>

# How to run the jar file
From Terminal, in the directory where PwGen.jar is stored, enter: <br>
`java -jar PwGen.jar`
